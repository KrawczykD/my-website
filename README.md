# This is my portfolio website create in react

### 
I built this weather application in React with using weather API.
 
 This app use free https://openweathermap.org/api.
 
 Thanks to that you can check current temp , wind speed and others details about weather in any place on the world. I used also JS , CSS and HTML to built this. This project learned me how to use API and how to manage data. I use React features like state and stateless components and life-cycle methods.
